# Investment Thesis
Repository with investment thesis developed in Carved Fountain Investment.

This repository will hold the different investment thesis that are developed inside this organization. Obviously, these thesis are not part of any financial advice, and just serve for educational purposes.

This repository will be completely public, sharing the humble and non professional knowledge I have on investment. The main idea is to create stock investment thesis that will be, surely, very improvable, so that anybody who is interested can share its own view and criticize all the aspects that need to be reviewed.

Initially, this repository will be written in both Spanish and English. Being Spanish my native language, I will start writing in such language, to translate the thesis to English later. Translations will be also welcomed to be reviewed.

In the end, this is just a repository to collect all the small knowledge I have been acquiring in the latest year regarding stock investment, and specifically related to value investing.

Before writing any investment thesis, the first thing to acknowledge will be to structurate an accurate investment thesis template. Moreover this, some guidance on my particular investment requirements will also be collected. That way, some filters for my particular investing phylosophy will exist, so that thesis are more easy to construct. Apart from that, these templates will be followed and adapted to the different sectors where the companies to be analyzed belong.
